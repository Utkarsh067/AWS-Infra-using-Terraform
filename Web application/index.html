    <h1>This project automates the deployment of a Docker-based web application on AWS infrastructure using Terraform. </h1>
    <h3>The key components include:

        <ol>
            <li>
                Provisioning a VPC, subnet, security group, internet gateway, and EC2 instance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Configuring networking for internet access, including an elastic IP.
            </li>
            <li>
                Installing Docker on the EC2 instance and running the web app container.
            </li>
            <li>
                Outputting the public IP for accessing the deployed application.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </h3>

    <h3>Terraform is used to create the infrastructure as code, making the deployment repeatable and easily modifiable. The web app runs in a Docker container, providing a consistent runtime environment. </h3>
    <h3>The Terraform configuration sets up the necessary AWS resources and handles the Docker setup on the EC2 instance through a user data script. This allows the complete deployment to be automated, reducing manual intervention.
    <h3>The output shows the public IP address, which can be used to access the deployed web application.</p>
